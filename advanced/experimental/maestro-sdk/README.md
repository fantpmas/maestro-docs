# Maestro SDK

{% hint style="warning" %}
This is an experimental feature. It is not yet supported by Maestro Cloud and breaking changes might be introduced as we work on it.
{% endhint %}

Maestro SDK allows you to use certain advanced features of Maestro, such as [Mock Server](../maestro-mock-server/).&#x20;

Unlike default Maestro experience that operates on your app and requires no setup, SDK runs _as part of your application_ which is what allows it to have expanded functionality that would not have otherwise been possible.

The integration is quick and simple, just follow the instructions for your specific platform:

* Android
* iOS
* React Native
